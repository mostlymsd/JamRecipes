My Favorite Jam &amp; Preserves Recipes

Making and canning jam is more than just a culinary task—it’s a labor of love rooted in heritage, sustainability, and community. I love making jam because it allows me to preserve the vibrant flavors of each season while honoring traditional methods passed down through generations. I loved helping my grandmother make and can fruit jams as a child. There’s something deeply fulfilling about taking fresh-picked strawberries, blueberries, or blackberries grown on our land and transforming them into something that brings comfort, joy, and nourishment to others.


Canning, for me, is an act of self-reliance and stewardship. It reflects the heart of my family upbringing. Now, making jam gives me the chance to reconnect people with the land through education, sustainability, and hands-on experiences. Each jar tells a story—from soil to stove to shelf and it’s a way to slow down, savor the moment, and share something meaningful. Whether I’m teaching a jam-making class, gifting a batch to family, friends, neighbors, or preparing for the market, I find joy in knowing that I’m preserving more than fruit—I’m preserving tradition, health, and the spirit of togetherness.
